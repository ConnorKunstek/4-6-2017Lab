To compile:
    g++ -std=c++11 -o Fly main.cpp
    ./Fly <Tests/#.in >Tests/#.out
    ***Replacing # with a test file (1-7)

This algorithm allows the spider to search the entirety of its available path
for a fly and report its success or failure. This algorithm takes into account
the shape of a real 3 dimensional donut (torus). It can search any size grid up 
to 100 x 100.
